# Super Galactic Age Calculator

#### Solo project for Epicodus JavaScript Week 1 _2017_

#### by **Adam Smith**

## Description

This application will return a user's age and life expectancy based on the solar years of a selected planet. The output will be based on the inputted birth-date, continent of origin, whether the user smokes or exercises, and which planet they choose.

## Setup

  1. Open Terminal or Command Line.
  2. Change directories to where you would like to clone the files.
  3. Run
  `$ git clone https://github.com/alspdx/super-galactic-age-calculator.git`.
  4. Change directories to the super-galactic-age-calculator directory.
  5. Run the following in the command line:
  ```
  $ npm install
  $ bower install
  $ gulp build
  $ gulp serve
  ```

## Technologies Used:
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* NPM
* Bower
* Gulp
* Babel
* Jasmine
* Karma

## Future Functionality

Given more time I would add styling to the front end, and the planets Saturn and Neptune to the options. I would also add more accurate life expectancy data based on more specific demographical information.
